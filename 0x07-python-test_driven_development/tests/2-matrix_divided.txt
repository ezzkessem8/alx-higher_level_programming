# Test cases for matrix_divided function

>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> matrix
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Testing with non-integer or non-float matrix elements
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 'a'],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Testing with matrices of different row sizes
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5]
... ]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Testing with div not being a number
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 'a')
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number

# Testing with div equal to 0
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero
